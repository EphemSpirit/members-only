<h1>Members Only</h1>

<p>
  This is my solution for the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication">Members Only</a> project, as part of
  <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> curriculum.
</p>

<p>
  This project was to practice User authentication using the Devise gem. Members can sign up and post messages to a main index page. The author of the article, however, is only displayed if you are currently logged in. If not, no author is displayed>
</p>

<p>
  I also added a basic API (for practice) so I can grab raw JSON data for members and posts.
